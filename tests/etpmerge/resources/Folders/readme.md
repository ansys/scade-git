# Folders: Test Notes
## Goals
This test suite is used to ensure the folders and their attributes are properly merged/reconciled.

It does not consider the use cases which have their own test suites, for example:
* Modification of the hierarchy through drag and drop.

## Folders
One folder per usual operation: modification, deletion or creation.

Exception: the folder Rename Root All has also modification of its attributes to test two conflicts on the same object.
