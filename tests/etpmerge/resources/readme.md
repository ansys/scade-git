# Test Notes
Use `RunGitTest.bat <param>` to perform the tests with Git. This command file creates two branches, `test/<param>` and `test/<param>_ex`, and commits/merges the different versions of the projects in each directory. Refer to the batch file's header for more details.

Use `CleanGitTest.bat <param>` to delete the two branches created by `RunGitTest.bat`.
