# Files: Test Notes
## Goals
This test suite is used to ensure the files and their attributes are properly merged/reconciled.

It does not consider the use cases which have their own test suites, for example:
* Modification of the folder's hierarchy through drag and drop.

It contains additional tests for properties, in particular for the properties independent of a configuration.

## Files
One file per usual operation: modification, deletion or creation.
